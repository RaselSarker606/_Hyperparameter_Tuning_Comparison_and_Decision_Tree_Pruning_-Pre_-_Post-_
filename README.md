# 📌 Hyperparameter Tuning Comparison and Decision Tree Pruning (Pre & Post)


## 📖 Overview  
This project explores **Hyperparameter Tuning** techniques and **Decision Tree Pruning (Pre & Post)** to optimize model performance. The goal is to compare different tuning approaches and analyze the impact of pruning on decision trees.

## 📂 Key Concepts  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**  
  - Grid Search  
  - Random Search  
  
- **Decision Tree Pruning**  
  - Pre-Pruning (Early Stopping, Max Depth, Min Samples)  
  - Post-Pruning (Cost Complexity Pruning - CCP)  

## 🛠️ Methodology  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Feature encoding and scaling  
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   - Comparing **Grid Search**, **Random Search**
3. **Decision Tree Pruning**  
   - Implementing **Pre-Pruning** techniques to control overfitting  
   - Applying **Post-Pruning (CCP)** to simplify the tree  
4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Performance Metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, Precision, Recall  

## 📊 Results  
- **Best hyperparameter tuning method identified**  
- **Improved model generalization with pruning techniques**  
- **Trade-offs between tree complexity and accuracy**
